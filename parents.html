  <h1>Brain Game For Toddler</h1>      
  <p>Most of the brain games are not suitable for children, being initially designed for adults. But, 
  if there is a desire to learn the IQ of a toddler, our games are designed to help you with that. 
  It is normal for parents to test the sharpness of mind of their offspring, which will make it possible to see 
  whether it is worth paying more attention to their intellectual development. 
  Naturally, it is interesting to parents to learn what kind of abilities a child has, 
  if there are any problems with psycho-emotional well-being, what his/her IQ is. 
  But this games are for fun, don't take it seriously. 
  If your toddler like it then let us know and try to make them parctice frequently and they will be sharper undoubtedly.</p>

  <h1>Brain Game For Preschooler</h1>      
  <p>The individual measurement of children's abilities can be accurately determined with the help of IQ tests. Thanks to this, parents can maximize the potential of their children, take appropriate measures to support little ones with disabilities, or just identify the most appropriate path of development.
    This test provides equal opportunities for “good” and “bad” students. Indeed, there is not a single question concerning the general culture in this test. It also does not take into account both child’s verbal and academic knowledge. No preparation or special knowledge is needed for this test.

How is it recommended to take the test? You can read the question and all the answers out loud, and the child looks at the screen - he should also be able to read some questions and answers on his own. Pass this test individually with the child.</p>
